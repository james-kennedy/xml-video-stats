Automates some statistical analysis for video coding. Takes .xml and .txt files as input (in the format generated by ANVIL (http://www.anvil-software.org/), but with the same formatting, other software packages could be used to create the input), and outputs within the software, or more extensively to Microsoft Excel.

For general statistical totals and correlations, the .anvil files produced by ANVIL (the standard save files, which use xml formatting) can be placed in a folder. This folder is passed to the program, and it will loop through these files. No other files should be placed in this folder. Of course, if you format any video coding files in the same way as anvil, and change the extension, then the program will run in the same manner.

To run a batch of inter-coder agreements, .txt files with frame-by-frame coding are instead required (export from ANVIL through File->Export->Annotation frame-by-frame). These files should be placed in folders of matched pairs (so MyFolder1 has MyAnnotation_video1_coder1 and MyAnnotation_video1_coder2, MyFolder2 for video2, and so on). Provide the folder at the level above to the software - it will loop through the inner folders and output the inter-coder agreement for each pair in an Excel spreadsheet.

This software has tight integration with Microsoft Excel, but the statistical processing and output to Excel are separated in the code. It should be straightforward to modify the code to output to a format/location of your choice.
